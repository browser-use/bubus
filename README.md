# `bubus`: 📢 Production-ready event bus library for Python

Bubus is a fully-featured, Pydantic-powered event bus library for async Python.

It's designed for quickly building event-driven applications with Python in a way that "just works" with async support, proper support for nested events, and real concurrency control.

It provides a [pydantic](https://docs.pydantic.dev/latest/)-based API for implementing publish-subscribe patterns with type safety, async/sync handler support, and advanced features like event forwarding between buses. It's inspired by the simplicity of `JS`'s async system and DOM events APIs, and it aims to bring a fully type-checked [`EventTarget`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/EventTarget)-style API to Python.

## 🔢 Quickstart

Install bubus and get started with a simple event-driven application:

```bash
pip install bubus
```

```python
import asyncio
from bubus import EventBus, BaseEvent
from your_auth_events import AuthRequestEvent, AuthResponseEvent

bus = EventBus()

class UserLoginEvent(BaseEvent):
    username: str
    timestamp: float

async def handle_login(login_event: UserLoginEvent):
    auth_request = await bus.dispatch(AuthRequestEvent(...))  # dispatch a nested event
    auth_response = await bus.expect(AuthResponseEvent)       # wait for an event to be seen

    print(f"User {event.username} logged in at {event.timestamp} with API key: {await auth_response.event_result()}")
    return {"status": "success", "user": event.username}


bus.on(UserLoginEvent, handle_login)

event = bus.dispatch(UserLoginEvent(username="alice", timestamp=1234567890))
result = await event
print(f"Login handled: {result.event_results}")
```

## ✨ Features

### 🔠 Type-Safe Events with Pydantic

Define events as Pydantic models with full type checking and validation:

```python
from typing import Any
from bubus import BaseEvent

class OrderCreatedEvent(BaseEvent):
    order_id: str
    customer_id: str
    total_amount: float
    items: list[dict[str, Any]]

# Events are automatically validated
event = OrderCreatedEvent(
    order_id="ORD-123",
    customer_id="CUST-456", 
    total_amount=99.99,
    items=[{"sku": "ITEM-1", "quantity": 2}]
)
```

### 🔀 Async and Sync Handler Support

Register both synchronous and asynchronous handlers for maximum flexibility:

```python
# Async handler
async def async_handler(event: BaseEvent):
    await asyncio.sleep(0.1)  # Simulate async work
    return "async result"

# Sync handler
def sync_handler(event: BaseEvent):
    return "sync result"

bus.on('MyEvent', async_handler)
bus.on('MyEvent', sync_handler)
```

Handlers can also be defined under classes for easier organization:

```python
class SomeService:
    some_value = 'this works'

    async def handlers_can_be_methods(self, event: BaseEvent):
        return self.some_value
    
    @classmethod
    async def handler_can_be_classmethods(cls, event: BaseEvent):
        return cls.some_value

    @staticmethod
    async def handlers_can_be_staticmethods(event: BaseEvent):
        return 'this works too'

# All usage patterns behave the same:
bus.on('MyEvent', SomeClass().handlers_can_be_methods)
bus.on('MyEvent', SomeClass.handler_can_be_classmethods)
bus.on('MyEvent', SomeClass.handlers_can_be_staticmethods)
```

### 🔎 Event Pattern Matching

Subscribe to events using multiple patterns:

```python
# By event type string
bus.on('UserActionEvent', handler)

# By event model class
bus.on(UserActionEvent, handler)

# Wildcard - handle all events
bus.on('*', universal_handler)
```

### ⏩ Forward `Events` Between `EventBus`s 

You can define separate `EventBus` instances in different "microservices" to separate different areas of concern.
`EventBus`s can be set up to forward events between each other (with automatic loop prevention):

```python
# Create a hierarchy of buses
main_bus = EventBus(name='MainBus')
auth_bus = EventBus(name='AuthBus')
data_bus = EventBus(name='DataBus')

# Forward events between buses (infinite loops are automatically prevented)
main_bus.on('AuthEvent', auth_bus.dispatch)
auth_bus.on('*', data_bus.dispatch)

# Events flow through the hierarchy with tracking
event = main_bus.dispatch(MyEvent())
await event
print(event.event_path)  # ['MainBus', 'AuthBus', 'DataBus']  # list of buses that have already procssed the event
```

### 🔱 Event Results Aggregation

Collect and aggregate results from multiple handlers:

```python
async def load_user_config(event) -> dict[str, Any]:
    return {"debug": True, "port": 8080}

async def load_system_config(event) -> dict[str, Any]:
    return {"debug": False, "timeout": 30}

bus.on('GetConfig', load_user_config)
bus.on('GetConfig', load_system_config)

# Get a merger of all dict results
event = await bus.dispatch(GetConfig())
config = await event.event_results_flat_dict(raise_if_conflicts=False)
# {'debug': False, 'port': 8080, 'timeout': 30}

# Or get individual results
results = await event.event_results()
```

### 🚦 FIFO Event Processing

Events are processed in strict FIFO order, maintaining consistency:

```python
# Events are processed in the order they were dispatched
for i in range(10):
    bus.dispatch(ProcessTaskEvent(task_id=i))

# Even with async handlers, order is preserved
await bus.wait_until_idle()
```

If a handler dispatches and awaits any child events during execution, those events will jump the FIFO queue and be processed immediately:
```python
def child_handler(event: SomeOtherEvent) -> str:
    return 'xzy123'

def main_handler(event: MainEvent) -> str:
    # enqueue event for processing after main_handler exits
    child_event = bus.dispatch(SomeOtherEvent())
    
    # can also await child events to process immediately instead of adding to FIFO queue
    completed_child_event = await child_event
    return f'result from awaiting child event: {await completed_child_event.event_result()}'  # 'xyz123'

bus.on(SomeOtherEvent, child_handler)
bus.on(MainEvent, main_handler)

await bus.dispatch(MainEvent()).event_result()
# result from awaiting child event: xyz123
```

### 🧹 Memory Management

EventBus includes automatic memory management to prevent unbounded growth in long-running applications:

```python
# Create a bus with memory limits (default: 50 events)
bus = EventBus(max_history_size=100)  # Keep max 100 events in history

# Or disable memory limits for unlimited history
bus = EventBus(max_history_size=None)
```

**Automatic Cleanup:**
- When `max_history_size` is set, EventBus automatically removes old events when the limit is exceeded
- Completed events are removed first (oldest first), then started events, then pending events
- This ensures active events are preserved while cleaning up old completed events

**Manual Memory Management:**
```python
# For request-scoped buses (e.g. web servers), clear all memory after each request
try:
    event_service = EventService()  # Creates internal EventBus
    await event_service.process_request()
finally:
    # Clear all event history and remove from global tracking
    await event_service.eventbus.stop(clear=True)
```

**Memory Monitoring:**
- EventBus automatically monitors total memory usage across all instances
- Warnings are logged when total memory exceeds 50MB
- Use `bus.stop(clear=True)` to completely free memory for unused buses
- To avoid memory leaks from big events, the default limits are intentionally kept low. events are normally processed as they come in, and there is rarely a need to keep every event in memory longer after its complete. long-term storage should be accomplished using other mechanisms, like the WAL

### ⛓️ Parallel Handler Execution

Enable parallel processing of handlers for better performance.  
The tradeoff is slightly less deterministic ordering as handler execution order will not be guaranteed when run in parallel.

```python
# Create bus with parallel handler execution
bus = EventBus(parallel_handlers=True)

# Multiple handlers run concurrently for each event
bus.on('DataEvent', slow_handler_1)  # Takes 1 second
bus.on('DataEvent', slow_handler_2)  # Takes 1 second

start = time.time()
await bus.dispatch(DataEvent())
# Total time: ~1 second (not 2)
```

### 🪆 Dispatch Nested Child Events From Handlers

Automatically track event relationships and causality tree:

```python
async def parent_handler(event: BaseEvent):
    # handlers can emit more events to be processed asynchronously after this handler completes
    child = ChildEvent()
    child_event_async = event.event_bus.dispatch(child)   # equivalent to bus.dispatch(...)
    assert child.event_status != 'completed'
    assert child_event_async.event_parent_id == event.event_id
    await child_event_async

    # or you can dispatch an event and block until it finishes processing by awaiting the event
    # this recursively waits for all handlers, including if event is forwarded to other buses
    # (note: awaiting an event from inside a handler jumps the FIFO queue and will process it immediately, before any other pending events)
    child_event_sync = await bus.dispatch(ChildEvent())
    # ChildEvent handlers run immediately
    assert child_event_sync.event_status == 'completed'

    # in all cases, parent-child relationships are automagically tracked
    assert child_event_sync.event_parent_id == event.event_id

async def run_main():
    bus.on(ChildEvent, child_handler)
    bus.on(ParentEvent, parent_handler)

    parent_event = bus.dispatch(ParentEvent())
    print(parent_event.event_children)           # show all the child events emitted during handling of an event
    await parent_event
    print(bus.log_tree())
    await bus.stop()

if __name__ == '__main__':
    asyncio.run(run_main())
```

### ⏳ Expect an Event to be Dispatched

Wait for specific events to be seen on a bus with optional filtering:

```python
# Block until a specific event is seen (with optional timeout)
request_event = await bus.dispatch(RequestEvent(id=123, table='invoices', request_id=999234))
response_event = await bus.expect(ResponseEvent, timeout=30)
```

A more complex real-world example showing off all the features:

```python
async def on_generate_invoice_pdf(event: GenerateInvoiceEvent) -> pdf:
    request_event = await bus.dispatch(APIRequestEvent(  # example: fire a backend request via some RPC client using bubus
        method='invoices.generatePdf',
        invoice_id=event.invoice_id,
        request_id=uuid4(),
    ))
    # ...rpc client should send the request, then call event_bus.dispatch(APIResponseEvent(...)) when it gets a response ...

    # wait for the response event to be fired by the RPC client
    is_our_response = lambda response_event: response_event.request_id == request_event.request_id
    is_succesful = lambda response_event: response_event.invoice_id == event.invoice_id and response_event.invoice_url
    try:
        response_event: APIResponseEvent = await bus.expect(
            APIResponseEvent,                                         # wait for events of this type (also accepts str name)
            include=lambda e: is_our_response(e) and is_succesful(e), # only include events that match a certain filter func
            exclude=lambda e: e.status != 'retrying',                 # optionally exclude certain events, overrides include
            timeout=30,                                               # raises asyncio.TimeoutError if no match is seen within 30sec
        )
    except asyncio.TimeoutError:
        await bus.dispatch(TimedOutError(msg='timed out while waiting for response from server', request_id=request_event.id))

    return response_event.invoice_url

event_bus.on(GenerateInvoiceEvent, on_generate_invoice_pdf)
```

> [!IMPORTANT]
> `expect()` resolves when the event is first *dispatched* to the `EventBus`, not when it completes. `await response_event` to get the completed event.

### 📝 Write-Ahead Logging

Persist events automatically to a `jsonl` file for future replay and debugging:

```python
# Enable WAL event log persistence (optional)
bus = EventBus(name='MyBus', wal_path='./events.jsonl')

# All completed events are automatically appended as JSON lines to the end
bus.dispatch(SecondEventAbc(some_key="banana"))
```

`./events.jsonl`:
```json
{"event_type": "FirstEventXyz", "event_created_at": "2025-07-10T20:39:56.462000+00:00", "some_key": "some_val", ...}
{"event_type": "SecondEventAbc", ..., "some_key": "banana"}
...
```

### 🎯 Event Return Values

There are two ways to get return values from event handlers:

**1. Have handlers return their values directly, which puts them in `event.event_results`:**

```python
def do_some_math(event: DoSomeMathEvent[int]) -> int:                                                                                                                        
    return event.a + event.b

event_bus.on(DoSomeMathEvent, do_some_math)
print(await event_bus.dispatch(DoSomeMathEvent(a=100, b=120)).event_result())
# 220
```

**2. Have the handler do the work, then dispatch another event containing the result value, which other code can expect:**

```python
def do_some_math(event: DoSomeMathEvent[int]) -> int:
    result = event.a + event.b
    event.event_bus.dispatch(MathCompleteEvent(final_sum=result))

event_bus.on(DoSomeMathEvent, do_some_math)
await event_bus.dispatch(DoSomeMathEvent(a=100, b=120))
result_event = await event_bus.expect(MathCompleteEvent)
print(result_event.final_sum)
# 220
```

#### Type-Safe Return Values with Generics

If you end up having handlers return their values directly, you can take advantage of `event_result_type` enforcement via generics:

```python
# To make an event that expects all handlers to return bytes, you would define it like so:

class ScreenshotEvent(BaseEvent[bytes]):
    event_result_type = bytes

    url: str
    width: int = 1440
    height: int = 1990

async def on_ScreenshotEvent(event: ScreenshotEvent) -> bytes:
    return await ScreenshotHelper.screenshot_to_bytes(
        event.url, 
        {'width': event.width, 'height': event.height}
    )

event_bus.on(ScreenshotEvent, on_ScreenshotEvent)

screenshot = await event_bus.dispatch(ScreenshotEvent(url='https://example.com')).event_result()
assert isinstance(screenshot, bytes), 'bubus will enforce that event_result() will only return bytes, or raise an exception if no handler has returned bytes'
```

You can also define more complex expected return values using Pydantic models:

```python
class EmailMessage(BaseModel):
    subject: str
    content_len: int
    email_from: str
    ...

### Events
class FetchInboxEvent(BaseEvent[list[EmailMessage]]): # <-- set BaseEvent[ResultTypeHere] for static type hints in IDE
    account_id: UUID
    auth_key: str

    event_result_type = list[EmailMessage] # <----- set event_result_type to enforce return value types at runtime

### Handlers
async def fetch_from_gmail(event: FetchInboxEvent) -> list[EmailMessage]:
    if not GoogleAPI.account_exists(event.account_id):
        raise Exception('credentials not applicable / not working for Gmail')
    return [EmailMessage(subject=msg.subj, ...) for msg in GmailAPI.get_msgs(event.account_id, ...)] # return types are enforced statically & at runtime

async def fetch_from_yahoo(event: FetchInboxEvent) -> list[EmailMessage]:
    if not YahooAPI.account_exists(event.account_id):
        raise Exception('credentials not applicable / not working for Yahoo')
    return [EmailMessage(subject=msg.subj, ...) for msg in YahooAPI.get_msgs(event.account_id, ...)]

event_bus.on(FetchInboxEvent, fetch_from_gmail)
event_bus.on(FetchInboxEvent, fetch_from_yahoo)

### Example Usage
fetch_event = FetchInboxEvent(account_id='124', ...)
all_emails = await event_bus.dispatch(fetch_event).event_results_flat_list(raise_if_any=False)  # ignores any exceptions and flatten list results into one list
print(all_emails)
# [EmailMessage(...), EmailMessage(...), EmailMessage(...), ...]
```

## 📚 API Documentation

### `EventBus`

The main event bus class that manages event processing and handler execution.

```python
EventBus(
    name: str | None = None,
    wal_path: Path | str | None = None,
    parallel_handlers: bool = False,
    max_history_size: int | None = 50
)
```

**Parameters:**

- `name`: Optional unique name for the bus (auto-generated if not provided)
- `wal_path`: Path for write-ahead logging of events to a `jsonl` file (optional)
- `parallel_handlers`: If `True`, handlers run concurrently for each event, otherwise serially if `False` (the default)
- `max_history_size`: Maximum number of events to keep in history (default: 50, None = unlimited)

#### `EventBus` Properties

- `name`: The bus identifier
- `id`: Unique UUID7 for this bus instance
- `event_history`: Dict of all events the bus has seen by event_id (limited by `max_history_size`)
- `events_pending`: List of events waiting to be processed
- `events_started`: List of events currently being processed
- `events_completed`: List of completed events
- `all_instances`: Class-level WeakSet tracking all active EventBus instances (for memory monitoring)


#### `EventBus` Methods

##### `on(event_type: str | Type[BaseEvent], handler: Callable)`

Subscribe a handler to events matching a specific event type or `'*'` for all events.

```python
bus.on('UserEvent', handler_func)  # By event type string
bus.on(UserEvent, handler_func)    # By event class
bus.on('*', handler_func)          # Wildcard - all events
```

##### `dispatch(event: BaseEvent) -> BaseEvent`

Enqueue an event for processing and return the pending `Event` immediately (synchronous).

```python
event = bus.dispatch(MyEvent(data="test"))
result = await event  # await the pending Event to get the completed Event
```

**Note:** When `max_history_size` is set, EventBus enforces a hard limit of 100 pending events (queue + processing) to prevent runaway memory usage. Dispatch will raise `RuntimeError` if this limit is exceeded.

##### `expect(event_type: str | Type[BaseEvent], timeout: float | None=None, predicate: Callable[[BaseEvent], bool]=None) -> BaseEvent`

Wait for a specific event to occur.

```python
# Wait for any UserEvent
event = await bus.expect('UserEvent', timeout=30)

# Wait with custom filter
event = await bus.expect(
    'UserEvent',
    predicate=lambda e: e.user_id == 'specific_user'
)
```

##### `wait_until_idle(timeout: float | None=None)`

Wait until all events are processed and the bus is idle.

```python
await bus.wait_until_idle()             # wait indefinitely until EventBus has finished processing all events

await bus.wait_until_idle(timeout=5.0)  # wait up to 5 seconds
```

##### `stop(timeout: float | None=None, clear: bool=False)`

Stop the event bus, optionally waiting for pending events and clearing memory.

```python
await bus.stop(timeout=1.0)  # Graceful stop, wait up to 1sec for pending and active events to finish processing
await bus.stop()             # Immediate shutdown, aborts all pending and actively processing events
await bus.stop(clear=True)   # Stop and clear all event history and handlers to free memory
```

---

### `BaseEvent`

Base class for all events. Subclass `BaseEvent` to define your own events.

Make sure none of your own event data fields start with `event_` or `model_` to avoid clashing with `BaseEvent` or `pydantic` builtin attrs.

#### `BaseEvent` Fields

```python
T_EventResultType = TypeVar('T_EventResultType', bound=Any, default=None)

class BaseEvent(BaseModel, Generic[T_EventResultType]):
    # Framework-managed fields
    event_type: str              # Defaults to class name
    event_id: str                # Unique UUID7 identifier, auto-generated if not provided
    event_timeout: float = 60.0  # Maximum execution in seconds for each handler
    event_schema: str            # Module.Class@version (auto-set based on class & LIBRARY_VERSION env var)
    event_parent_id: str         # Parent event ID (auto-set)
    event_path: list[str]        # List of bus names traversed (auto-set)
    event_created_at: datetime   # When event was created, auto-generated
    event_results: dict[str, EventResult]   # Handler results
    event_result_type: T_EventResultType = None
    
    # Data fields
    # ... subclass BaseEvent to add your own event data fields here ...
    # some_key: str
    # some_other_key: dict[str, int]
    # ...
```

`event.event_results` contains a dict of pending `EventResult` objects that will be completed once handlers finish executing.


#### `BaseEvent` Properties

- `event_status`: `Literal['pending', 'started', 'complete']` Event status
- `event_started_at`: `datetime` When first handler started processing
- `event_completed_at`: `datetime` When all handlers completed processing
- `event_children`: `list[BaseEvent]` Get any child events emitted during handling of this event
- `event_bus`: `EventBus` Shortcut to get the bus currently processing this event
- `event_result_type`: `type[Any] | None` Optional type/pydantic model to enforce for event handler return values

#### `BaseEvent` Methods

##### `await event`

Await the `Event` object directly to get the completed `Event` object once all handlers have finished executing.

```python
event = bus.dispatch(MyEvent())
completed_event = await event

raw_result_values = [(await event_result) for event_result in completed_event.event_results.values()]
# equivalent to: completed_event.event_results_list()  (see below)
```

##### `event_result(timeout: float | None=None, include: EventResultFilter=None, raise_if_any: bool=True, raise_if_none: bool=True) -> Any`

# Get result but don't raise exceptions or error for 0 results, just return None
result_or_none = await event.event_result(raise_if_any=False, raise_if_none=False)
```

##### `event_results_by_handler_id(timeout: float | None=None, include: EventResultFilter=None, raise_if_any: bool=True, raise_if_none: bool=True) -> dict`

Utility method helper to get all raw result values organized by `{handler_id: result_value}`.

**Parameters:**

# by default it returns all successful non-None result values
results = await event.event_results_by_handler_id()
# {'handler_id_1': result1, 'handler_id_2': result2}

# Only include results from handlers that returned integers
int_results = await event.event_results_by_handler_id(include=lambda r: isinstance(r.result, int))

all_results = await event.event_results_by_handler_id(raise_if_any=False, raise_if_none=False)
```

##### `event_results_list(timeout: float | None=None, include: EventResultFilter=None, raise_if_any: bool=True, raise_if_none: bool=True) -> list[Any]`

# Get all results without raising on errors
all_results = await event.event_results_list(raise_if_any=False, raise_if_none=False)
```

##### `event_results_flat_dict(timeout: float | None=None, include: EventResultFilter=None, raise_if_any: bool=True, raise_if_none: bool=False, raise_if_conflicts: bool=True) -> dict`

Utility method helper to merge all raw result values that are `dict`s into a single flat `dict`.

- `timeout`: Maximum time to wait for handlers to complete (None = use default event timeout)
- `include`: Filter function to include only specific results (default: only non-None, non-exception results)
- `raise_if_any`: If `True`, raise exception if any handler raises any `Exception` (`default: True`)
- `raise_if_none`: If `True`, raise exception if results are empty / all results are `None` or `Exception` (`default: False`)
- `raise_if_conflicts`: If `True`, raise exception if dict keys conflict between handlers (`default: True`)

# {'key1': 'value1', 'key2': 'value2'}

# Merge only dicts with specific keys
config_dicts = await event.event_results_flat_dict(include=lambda r: isinstance(r.result, dict) and 'config' in r.result)

# Allow conflicts, last handler wins
merged = await event.event_results_flat_dict(raise_if_conflicts=False)
```

##### `event_results_flat_list(timeout: float | None=None, include: EventResultFilter=None, raise_if_any: bool=True, raise_if_none: bool=True) -> list`

Utility method helper to merge all raw result values that are `list`s into a single flat `list`.

**Parameters:**

- `timeout`: Maximum time to wait for handlers to complete (None = use default event timeout)
- `include`: Filter function to include only specific results (default: only non-None, non-exception results)
- `raise_if_any`: If `True`, raise exception if any handler raises any `Exception` (`default: True`)
- `raise_if_none`: If `True`, raise exception if results are empty / all results are `None` or `Exception` (`default: True`)

```python
# by default it merges all successful list results
results = await event.event_results_flat_list()
# ['item1', 'item2', 'item3']

# Merge only lists with more than 2 items
long_lists = await event.event_results_flat_list(include=lambda r: isinstance(r.result, list) and len(r.result) > 2)

# Get all list results without raising on errors
all_items = await event.event_results_flat_list(raise_if_any=False, raise_if_none=False)
```

##### `event_bus` (property)

Shortcut to get the `EventBus` that is currently processing this event. Can be used to avoid having to pass an `EventBus` instance to your handlers.

```python
bus = EventBus()

async def some_handler(event: MyEvent):
    # You can always dispatch directly to any bus you have a reference to
    child_event = bus.dispatch(ChildEvent())
    
    # OR use the event.event_bus shortcut to get the current bus:
    child_event = await event.event_bus.dispatch(ChildEvent())
```

### `EventResult`

The placeholder object that represents the pending result from a single handler executing an event.  
`Event.event_results` contains a `dict[PythonIdStr, EventResult]` in the shape of `{handler_id: EventResult()}`.

You shouldn't need to ever directly use this class, it's an internal wrapper to track pending and completed results from each handler within `BaseEvent.event_results`.

#### `EventResult` Fields

```python
class EventResult(BaseModel):
    id: str                    # Unique identifier
    handler_id: str           # Handler function ID
    handler_name: str         # Handler function name
    eventbus_id: str          # Bus that executed this handler
    eventbus_name: str        # Bus name
    
    status: str               # 'pending', 'started', 'completed', 'error'
    result: Any               # Handler return value
    error: str | None         # Error message if failed
    
    started_at: datetime      # When handler started
    completed_at: datetime    # When handler completed
    timeout: float            # Handler timeout in seconds
    child_events: list[BaseEvent] # list of child events emitted during handler execution
```

#### `EventResult` Methods

##### `await result`

Await the `EventResult` object directly to get the raw result value.

```python
handler_result = event.event_results['handler_id']
value = await handler_result  # Returns result or raises an exception if handler hits an error
```

## 🧵 Advanced Concurrency Control

### `@retry` Decorator

The `@retry` decorator provides automatic retry functionality with built-in concurrency control for any function, including event handlers. This is particularly useful when handlers interact with external services that may temporarily fail.

```python
from bubus import EventBus, BaseEvent
from bubus.helpers import retry

bus = EventBus()

class FetchDataEvent(BaseEvent):
    url: str

@retry(
    wait=2,                     # Wait 2 seconds between retries
    retries=3,                  # Retry up to 3 times after initial failure
    timeout=5,                  # Each attempt times out after 5 seconds
    semaphore_limit=5,          # Max 5 concurrent executions
    backoff_factor=1.5,         # Exponential backoff: 2s, 3s, 4.5s
    retry_on=(TimeoutError, ConnectionError)  # Only retry on specific exceptions
)
async def fetch_with_retry(event: FetchDataEvent):
    # This handler will automatically retry on network failures
    async with aiohttp.ClientSession() as session:
        async with session.get(event.url) as response:
            return await response.json()

bus.on(FetchDataEvent, fetch_with_retry)
```

#### Retry Parameters

- **`timeout`**: Maximum amount of time function is allowed to take per attempt, in seconds (default: 5)
- **`retries`**: Number of additional retry attempts if function raises an exception (default: 3)
- **`retry_on`**: Tuple of exception types to retry on (default: `None` = retry on any `Exception`)
- **`wait`**: Base seconds to wait between retries (default: 3)
- **`backoff_factor`**: Multiplier for wait time after each retry (default: 1.0)
- **`semaphore_limit`**: Maximum number of concurrent calls that can run at the same time
- **`semaphore_scope`**: Scope for the semaphore: `class`, `self`, `global`, or `multiprocess`
- **`semaphore_timeout`**: Maximum time to wait for a semaphore slot before proceeding or failing
- **`semaphore_lax`**: Continue anyway if semaphore fails to be acquired in within the given time
- **`semaphore_name`**: Unique semaphore name to allow sharing a semaphore between functions

#### Semaphore Options

Control concurrency with built-in semaphore support:

```python
# Global semaphore - all calls share one limit
@retry(semaphore_limit=3, semaphore_scope='global')
async def global_limited_handler(event): ...

# Per-class semaphore - all instances of a class share one limit
class MyService:
    @retry(semaphore_limit=2, semaphore_scope='class')
    async def class_limited_handler(self, event): ...

# Per-instance semaphore - each instance gets its own limit
class MyService:
    @retry(semaphore_limit=1, semaphore_scope='self')
    async def instance_limited_handler(self, event): ...

# Cross-process semaphore - all processes share one limit
@retry(semaphore_limit=5, semaphore_scope='multiprocess')
async def process_limited_handler(event): ...
```

#### Advanced Example

```python
import logging

# Configure logging to see retry attempts
logging.basicConfig(level=logging.INFO)

class DatabaseEvent(BaseEvent):
    query: str

class DatabaseService:
    @retry(
        wait=1,
        retries=5,
        timeout=10,
        semaphore_limit=10,          # Max 10 concurrent DB operations
        semaphore_scope='class',     # Shared across all instances
        semaphore_timeout=30,        # Wait up to 30s for semaphore
        semaphore_lax=False,         # Fail if can't acquire semaphore
        backoff_factor=2.0,          # Exponential backoff: 1s, 2s, 4s, 8s, 16s
        retry_on=(ConnectionError, TimeoutError)
    )
    async def execute_query(self, event: DatabaseEvent):
        # Automatically retries on connection failures
        # Limited to 10 concurrent operations across all instances
        result = await self.db.execute(event.query)
        return result

# Register the handler
db_service = DatabaseService()
bus.on(DatabaseEvent, db_service.execute_query)
```
